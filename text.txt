In this project I made a weather app using OpenWeather API featured by ChatGPT with HTML CSS and JS. By doing this project, ChatGPT helped me to understand better how API's work and how to implement them using JS. The first call of the page there is a GIF with a rotating Earth, a field to enter the city and a button, when you enter the city, the gif will move smoothly to the left and the information will be shown about the temperature, humidity , sunset/sunrise , pressure and so on.
